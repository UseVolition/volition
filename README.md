# Volition
### The faculty or power of using one's will.

Volition is more than a todo list. Itâ€™s a framework for becoming more effective. It encourages you to be intentional in planning your day and reflecting on the decisions you've made. Read about [the philosophy behind Volition](https://usevolition.com/philosophy "Philosophy behind Volition").

## Self Host Volition
#### We believe users should control their own data
New web applications and software products seem to be more ephemeral than ever. This is the reason Volition's users have the option to self-host our software. If Volition helps you as much as it has helped us, we want you to rest easy knowing you'll have it forever. Refer to our [self hosting guidelines](# "Volition self hosting guidelines")

## Contribute to Volition
Volition's code base will always be open source, and we welcome all contributions. Refer to our [contribution guidelines](# "Volition contribution guidelines") to learn how to help make Volition better.
