# Self-Hosting Volition

Volition is designed with self hosting in mind. Follow the steps below and you'll be up and running in no time.

## Deploying to Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/usevolition/volition)

1. <kbd>command</kbd> + click the button above to open your "Create New App" Heroku dashboard in a new tab.

2. Name your Heroku application whatever you want in the "App name" input box at the top of the "Create New App" form.

3. Click "Deploy app" at the bottom of the page. Heroku will provide a checklist of steps that it needs to complete.

4. Once Heroku has completed all the steps necessary for deployment, you'll have the options to "Manage app" or "View". Click "View" to see your self-hosted instance of Volition.

5. You're ready to start using your self-hosted instance of Volition!

#### Note: Using this method to deploy means that your instance of Volition will always be the version it is when you deploy. We plan to add detailed instructions on forking/cloning the code base and deploying from that fork or clone in the near future. This will allow you to keep your instance up to date with the production version of Volition.
